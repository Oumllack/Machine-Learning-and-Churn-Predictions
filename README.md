# Customer Churn Prediction: A Comprehensive Machine Learning Analysis
## A Scientific Study on Telecom Customer Retention

## Abstract

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of customer churn prediction in the telecommunications sector using advanced machine learning techniques. We analyze the Telco Customer Churn dataset, implement sophisticated feature engineering, handle class imbalance, and develop robust predictive models. Our analysis provides actionable insights for customer retention strategies and identifies key factors influencing customer churn. The study achieves high prediction accuracy while maintaining interpretability, making it valuable for both technical and business stakeholders.

## 1. Introduction

Customer churn, the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their service subscriptions, represents a significant challenge for telecommunications companies. The ability to predict and prevent churn is crucial for maintaining revenue and market share. This study leverages machine learning to analyze customer behavior patterns and develop predictive models that can identify at-risk customers before they churn.

**Figure 3:** Impact of internet service type on customer churn.

![Payment Method Impact](analysis/churn_by_PaymentMethod.png)
**Figure 4:** Impact of payment method on customer churn.

Key factors influencing churn:
1. **Contract Type**: Month-to-month contracts show higher churn risk
2. **Internet Service**: Fiber optic customers show higher churn rates
3. **Payment Method**: Electronic payment methods correlate with higher churn
4. **Technical Support**: Customers without tech support are more likely to churn
5. **Online Security**: Lack of online security increases churn risk

### 3.3 Model Performance

#### Random Forest Model
- ROC AUC: 0.84
- High precision and recall balance
- Strong performance in identifying at-risk customers

**Figure 8:** Distribution of customer tenure by churn status.

Characteristics of high-risk customers:
- Predominantly month-to-month contracts
- Higher monthly charges
- Shorter tenure
- Electronic payment methods
- Limited technical support
